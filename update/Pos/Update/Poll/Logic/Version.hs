-- Here we add check that block version data from proposal is consistent
-- with current data and add new 'BlockVersionState' if this is a new
-- version.
--
-- The following checks are performed:
--
-- 1. We check that versions and constants from proposal are the same as
-- versions and constants from other proposals with the same block version.
--
-- 2. But if the proposal has a new 'BlockVersion', we check that
-- a) its 'ScriptVersion' is @lastScriptVersion + 1@, and
-- b) its 'maxBlockSize' is at most 2Ã— the previous block size.
